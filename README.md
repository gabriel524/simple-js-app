 This project/repo is dedicated to building a Pok√©dex application by using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. To further elaborate, this Pokemon dictionary/app contain a list of 150 different pokemon buttons with their names.

In this app, after click on each pokemon name or button, it opens a modal with a picture of the Pokemon as well as basic information about that Pokemon such as name, height, types, and abilities. These information of the pokemon are loaded via the pokedex API, from an external database.

In this application, using both CSS JavaScript and HTML, a unique search bar have been created were users can simply write the name of a specific pokemon of their choice to get the pokemon they want from the list of pokedex. Therefore, users will not go through stress by strolling up or down the list of the pokemon to find/get a specific pokemon. This helps makes the app easy to navigate giving users the best interaction/experience with the application.
